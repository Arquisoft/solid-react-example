#solid-react-example
This is a sample react application that uses solid components

## How to
First, create a React application with `npx create-react-app solid-react-example`. This command will create a react sample application in the directory solid-react-example.

Lets add a dependecy to this project. We want to use [solid components](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react), lets use npm to add the required dependencies:

```
npm install -S @inrupt/solid-ui-react
```

in the file `package.json` you can see now that the line `"@inrupt/solid-ui-react": "^2.1.1"` has been added. This file is critical to install the dependencies in another computer (using `npm install`).

Now lets modify the code so we can use this components to make a basic login page against a solid server and then show some basic information extracted from the POD.
